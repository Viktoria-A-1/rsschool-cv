## About me: 
I am a 3rd year student at MSABC, but I decided to connect my life with programming. I have been actively studying this area for the past year. I signed up for a course to improve my skills and fully immerse myself in this area. I want to do web development and web design. I think that I will be able to study this area to the end, as I approach the tasks responsibly. I like to solve complex problems and I like to constantly develop and learn, and in this area it is necessary.
